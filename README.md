# C72h-whiteworms

Here we provide the code for reproducing the analyses of _Ethics in rotten apples:
A network epidemiology approach for active cyber defense, F. Bonacina, I. Echegoyen, D. Escribano, M. Krellner, F. P. Nerini, R. Shanaz, A. S. Teixeira and A. Aleta_ (https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2306.17533). In this project we investigated the spreading of two worms - a malware black worms and a benign white worm - on a network of devices, modeled with three types of graphs.
